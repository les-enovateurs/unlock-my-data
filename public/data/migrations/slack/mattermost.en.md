**Key Preparation Steps:**

## Define the scope of your migration:
	- **Slack edition:** Migrating from Slack Enterprise Grid requires additional planning and steps.
	- **Data history:** Decide how much message history you need to import. Importing only recent data (e.g., the last six months) can simplify and speed up the process.
	- **Export size:** The size of your Slack export file affects the migration duration. Files under ~25 GB often complete within a day, while exports over 100 GB may take several days.
	- **File attachments:** Consider excluding very large or non-essential attachments (such as old media or large downloads) to reduce the import size and speed up processing.
