After create a new email address with Tuta.

1. Open Gmail in a browser and log in.
2. In the top right, click 'Settings' and then 'See all settings'.
3. Click the 'Forwarding and POP/IMAP' tab.
4. In the Forwarding section, click 'Add a forwarding address'.
5. Enter your new Tuta email address you want to forward messages to.
6. Click 'Next' and then 'Proceed' and then 'OK'.
7. At the bottom of the page, click 'Save Changes'.
8. In Tuta you will receive an email from Gmail that asks you to accept the forwarded emails from Gmail. Click the verification link in this email.

From now on all emails sent to your Gmail account will be automatically forwarded to Tuta. You can inform important senders of your new Tuta email address and delete unimportant ones. This way, once you stop the auto-forward in Gmail, you will have a much cleaner inbox and get rid of all the unwanted newsletters that have accumulated over the last couple of years.
