## Step 1: Archive your X/Twitter data
To leave X/Twitter, you may want to keep a copy of your data before departing. This includes your tweets, followers, and followees.

**How to request your archive:**
- Go to [Request your archive from X/Twitter](https://www.escape-x.org/Leaving-Twitter-X-Step-1-Request-Your-Archive-from-X-Twitter.html)
- Or directly: [X/Twitter archive settings](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data)
- Official help: [Accessing your X data](https://help.x.com/fr/managing-your-account/accessing-your-x-data)

Twitter/X will require strong authentication (password, SMS/email). After requesting, wait 1-3 days for your archive. Download the .ZIP file when ready.

## Step 2: Create an account at Mastodon
- Visit [https://joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org) to choose an instance and sign up, or download the Mastodon app for Android/iPhone.
- See the guide: [Create an account on Mastodon and/or Bluesky](https://www.escape-x.org/Leaving-Twitter-X-Step-2-I-Create-an-Account-on-Mastodon-and-or-BlueSky.html)

## Step 3: Reconnect with your community
Use platforms like OpenPortability to reconnect with your contacts:
- Go to [OpenPortability](https://openportability.org/fr/auth/signin)
- Upload your archive to help find and reconnect with your followers and followees.

Everything happens locally in your browser. No passwords are stored, only the necessary data for reconnection. All shared data is destroyed after the process.
